## Design Brief
Client:
Ophthalmologists/Visually Impaired Patients

Design Statement:
Design, build and test a low-cost digital vision exam to provide an approximate assessment for a user’s visual acuity and a headset to assist in the calibration and setup of the exam. 

Measurable Constraints:
1. The visual acuity result is within 1-2 optotype rows of actual acuity.
2. The digital eye exam is completable within 5 minutes.
3. The digital optotype size is within 2 mm of actual size.
4. The headset’s length must not exceed 5 inches.
5. The headset’s width must not exceed 6 inches.
6. The headset must not weigh more than 0.55 lbs.
7. The headset’s material cost must not exceed $6.
8. The headset must fit head circumferences between 20 to 25 inches.
9. The device must be operational within a temperature range of 0°C to 40°C.
10. The headset’s components must be assembled within 3 minutes.
