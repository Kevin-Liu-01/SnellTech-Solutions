## Design Brief

- **Client**: Ophthalmologists / Visually Impaired Patients
- **Goal**: Design and build a digital vision exam providing an approximate assessment of visual acuity. The exam should be completed within 5 minutes using a simple calibration headset.

### Measurable Constraints:

- The visual acuity result should be within 1-2 optotype rows of actual acuity.
- The test should be completable within 5 minutes.
- The optotype size should be within 2 mm of the actual size.
- The headset should be compact (max 5” x 6”) and lightweight (< 0.55 lbs) with an affordable material cost of $6 or less.
- Designed to fit head circumferences from 20” to 25”.
- Operates in temperatures between 0°C and 40°C.
- Assembly time for the headset should not exceed 3 minutes.

## Project Overview

SnellTech Solutions provides an innovative digital vision exam and supporting headset, offering a low-cost alternative to traditional visual acuity tests. The system leverages advanced technology to deliver accurate results quickly and efficiently, making it an ideal solution for a wide range of users.
